# NYC Citywide Payroll
This project is the final project for the Data Analysis class. Other projects can be found at [Main Github Repo](https://github.com/amkhaliq)

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
New York City is the most populous city in the United States and as such has one of the largest, most inclusive city government agencies in the world. It is imperative that its payroll funds are allocated and distributed properly in order to adequately address the concerns and needs of its diverse set of many inhabitants.

The dataset used in this project is the [Citywide Payroll Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e). The Citywide Payroll dataset is a dataset containing the payroll information for NYC municipal employees in the years 2016-2019.

The purpose of this project is to properly analyze the data and observe how New York City allocates its payroll budget across its agencies. The difference in payroll from agency to agency and from borough to borough and the main factors involved that eventually lead to a municipal employee being paid as much as they are.

## Project Description
The database containing payroll information regarding the municipal employees within New York City. This dataset is publicly available because of public interest and concern over how New York City allocates and spends its budget. 

There are three main questions we aim to answer: 

* How does New York City allocate its payroll budget? 
* How does the payroll differ from agency-to-agency and from borough-to-borough?
* What are the main factors that lead to a municipal employee being paid as much as they are?

We expect to:
* extensively use density histograms to compare the distributions of different statistics
* to examine information like the differences between base pay and actual pay
* feature engineering is going to need to be employed to create new features
* the groupby() function will be employed to compare municipal employees across different boroughs, agencies, and leave status
* utilizing filtering methods, overtime pay will be compared across different agencies.
* the data will be split into training and testing sets and an elementary K-Nearest Neighbor regression will be created in order to attempt to predict payroll data for municipal employees.
